In our project, we've chosen to revive the timeless Pong game with a multiplayer twist. We're introducing user-selectable difficulty levels—normal, 
medium, and hard—where each level adjusts paddle sizes and speed for added challenge.


The significant feature(s) each member of the group was responsible for:
Cheska is responsible for the implementation of the graphical user interface (GUI), which includes designing the start menu, difficulty level 
selection menu, and the screen for the winner. Additionally, she created the general-purpose Menu class to enhance the overall functionality of the system.

3. Cheska - In the Pong game's menu design, I employed object-oriented concepts like inheritance and polymorphism. 
Inheritance facilitated specialized menus such as start and difficulty menus, enabling common functionalities to be reused while allowing for unique behaviors.
Polymorphism, through virtual functions, tailored menu actions for each type. Encapsulation organized data and methods within menu classes, 
enhancing code structure and preventing unintended access. Additionally, constructors and destructors were utilized to manage resource initialization and cleanup efficiently.
