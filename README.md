# CSE165_ImageProcessor
Image processor project for CSE 165 at UC Merced
The temptative functions for this image processor are:
1. Color to B&W                  *
2. Paintbrush                    ?
3. Resize                        *
4. Rotate                        *
5. Crop                          **
6. Adding shapes to the images   ***
7. Recolor and invert color      *
8. Gaussian filter               **
9. Median filter                 *
10. Sharpening image             *

More ideas can be pitched and put here, the starts are meant to represent the expected difficulty of implementing the functions
